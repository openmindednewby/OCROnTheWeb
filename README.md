# OCROnTheWeb
Simple OCR Model 100% Free that runs on the browser using webAssembly.
This project serves as an example on how to deploy on the web an OCR model. Essentially we build our python code as webAssembly and run it on the browser.

No need to compile python into web assembly when we have **tesseract.js** https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js
